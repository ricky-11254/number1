Ultimate Markdown is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to create WordPress posts with the popular [Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

== Description ==
Ultimate Markdown is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to create WordPress posts with the popular Markdown syntax.

Specifically, after installing the plugin, you will be able to:

* Create posts with perfectly formatted blocks from existing Markdown files or Markdown documents created with the plugin.
* Instantly generate blocks from Markdown text.
* Create and manage an unlimited number of Markdown documents in a dedicated plugin menu.
* Import Markdown file in WordPress.
* Create archives of Markdown files from the Markdown documents created with the plugin.

Please note that this plugin requires the use of the default [WordPress Blocks Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/). With third-party visual editors or with the [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/), you will not be able to use most of the plugin functionalities.

### Pro Version

We distribute the [Pro version](https://daext.com/ultimate-markdown/) of this plugin that includes more export options, REST API, additional Markdown parsers, document categories, and more.

### Additional post sidebar sections

The plugin adds the following sections to the post sidebar.

#### Import Markdown

This section allows you to generate the blocks of a post from an uploaded Markdown file.

#### Load Markdown

Use this feature to create the blocks of a post from a Markdown document previously created with the plugin.

#### Submit Markdown

With this section, you can instantly transform Markdown text to blocks.

### Dedicated plugin menus

#### Documents

This menu includes a Markdown editor with an HTML preview section. In addition, you will find functionalities to create, edit, duplicate or delete your Markdown documents.

#### Import

Import one or more Markdown files in the plugin with the upload form provided in this menu.

#### Export

With this menu, you can generate Markdown files from the Markdown documents stored in the plugin.

### Supported Markdown syntax

The conversion from Markdown text to HTML is performed with [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), a high-performance Markdown parser that supports documents written in the following [Markdown flavors](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/Markdown-Flavors).

### Front Matter

The plugin supports Front Matter key-value pairs provided in the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) language. With this feature, you can configure specific post settings by providing their values at the beginning of the Markdown document.

Please see the [plugin documentation](https://daext.com/doc/ultimate-markdown/) for more information on the available Front Matter keys and practical examples.
